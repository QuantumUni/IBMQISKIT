### Qiskit SDK: 
	Qiskit SDK is an open-source SDK for working quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives.

### Qiskit Runtime:
	Qiskit Runtime is an IBM service to run on quantum hardware through the cloud

### Qiskit Patterns:
	Qistkit Patterns is a framework for breaking down domain-specific problems into stages.
### Qiskit Ecosystem:
	Is a collection of software and projects that built on or extend Qiskit.

#### Qiskit Patterns:
1. Map problem to quantum circuits and operators
2. Optimize circuits for target hardware
3. Execute on target hardware
4. Postprocess results

#### To map a problem:
- Start with a numerical representation
- Map to quantum computing representation
- Choose quantum algorithm


### Build a circuit with Qiskit SDK

The foundation of quantum programs are **Quantum Circuits**
